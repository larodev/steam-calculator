# Steam calculator

This app gives you the order in which you need to add your veggies to the steamer in order to cook each veggie the right time.

Order is calculated as: 

- Vegetables with similar cooking times (+/- 3 minutes) are group together
- Every time the pot is opened, 2 minutes are added to compensate the heat loss
